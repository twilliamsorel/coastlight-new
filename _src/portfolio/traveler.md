Traveler is a concept logo created by Trevor Sorel, designed for a personal travel blog. He drew the logo with softly vibrant blues and reds that evoke the sky, hot air baloons, and old airplanes. The circular motion of the logo subtly captures the fluid gestalt of a spinning propeller shaft, preparing for takeoff.
