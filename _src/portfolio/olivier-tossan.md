Olivier Tossan is an artist and creative developer with over over a decade of experience in animation. 

We worked with him to create a custom visual portfolio to showcase his work to future employers and clients. This was a collaborative effort, and we worked with Olivier, who designed his own logo and gave feedback on the designs.
