Jeffrey Haver is an entrepreneur and blogger who focuses on Christian issues. 

We helped Jeff to migrate his blog from a dated wordpress site to a custom static solution. We came up with a new brand, as well as redesigned the site to be simpler, more legible, and easy to navigate. Of note here was a custom search feature we built into the site.
