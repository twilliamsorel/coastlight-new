On the Move was a concept application designed by Trevor Sorel as he was investigating user experience. The app was designed to help movers track the progress of their moves when working with hired professionals. 

Trevor (Coastlight) developed the brand identity, based on greens that evoke summer and the grassy fields of a new home. He designed the app with minimalism and clarity in mind, focus on a few key elements of functionality that would give the user the most value. From user interviews he determined this to be an interactive map of the moving truck's current location.
