Boesel Built is a general contracting business run out of Marin County, focusing on residential construction projects. 

We designed a new logo and brand image for the company, working with the proprietor to come up with a suitable color scheme and developing a custom logo to set their brand apart. The result was a hammer-inlaid B, an iconograph that alluded to the founder's last name, as well as the construction-based nature of their work. We set this icon in a pallet of cool colors to give it an authoritative and professional feel.
