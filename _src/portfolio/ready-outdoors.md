Ready Outdoors was another concept application designed by Trevor Sorel as he explored user experience design. The application provided users with information on various outdoor areas to help them stay safe and informed when venturing into the wilderness. 

Trevor (Coastlight) developed the logo with this functionality in mind, evoking the greens of nature and ruggedness of the mountains to signal the outdoors.
