The above burlington logo was a practice piece designed by Trevor Sorel. As an exercise, he created an alternative brand for the clothing chain "Burlington Coat Factory". He decided on a bold and youthful approach that utilized the profile of a bear&mdash;a shaggy, sturdy animal, to evoke a feeling of warmth and security.
