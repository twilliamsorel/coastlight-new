Middle Ground was a news blogging concept created by Trevor Sorel. The idea was to create a political commentary blog that focused on unifying messages and tried to break away from divisive party narratives. 

While the project never came to fruition, Sorel did finish the branding, as well as a mockup of what the homepage might look like (not currently included in this portfolio). The logo utilizes a dark hue of blue, as found in the American flag, as well as a star. These elements are paired with a serif font to add a timeless and authoritative feel.
