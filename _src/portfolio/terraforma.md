Terraforma is an agricultural technology startup that builds advanced composting systems using biotechnology. 

We worked with them to develop a brand, a content strategy, designed, and built their website. Their complementary color pallet subtly evokes the hues of plant and soil, as well as the vibrancy of the equatorial regions wherein they often work. The site itself features photography of traditional farm regions and of sustainable farming practices.
